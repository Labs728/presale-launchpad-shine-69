## Technical Implementation Details

### Responsive Design Strategy
1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Started with mobile styles and progressively enhanced
2. **Tailwind Breakpoints Used**:
   - `sm:` 640px and up (small tablets and up)
   - `md:` 768px and up (tablets and up)  
   - `lg:` 1024px and up (laptops and up)
   - `xl:` 1280px and up (large desktops)

### Key Responsive Patterns Applied
1. **Progressive Text Scaling**: `text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-7xl`
2. **Adaptive Padding**: `p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8`
3. **Grid Responsiveness**: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
4. **Conditional Display**: `hidden lg:block` for complex elements
5. **Spacing Optimization**: `gap-4 sm:gap-6 lg:gap-8`
